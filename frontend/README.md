## API Integration

The app currently uses a mock API (`src/services/mockApi.ts`) that simulates real backend functionality. To switch to a live API:

### Current Mock Endpoints
- `POST /api/analyze` - Analyze resume vs job description
- `GET /api/history` - Get analysis history
- `GET /api/history/:id` - Get specific analysis
- `DELETE /api/history/:id` - Delete analysis

### Switching to Live API

1. **Create a new API service file**:
   ```typescript
   // src/services/liveApi.ts
   const API_BASE = process.env.VITE_API_URL || 'https://your-api.com';
   
   export const liveApi = {
     async analyze(data) {
       const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/analyze`, {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
         body: JSON.stringify(data)
       });
       return response.json();
     },
     // ... other methods
   };
   ```

2. **Update imports in components**:
   ```typescript
   // Replace mockApi imports
   import { liveApi as api } from '../services/liveApi';
   ```

3. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # .env.local
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-api.com
   ```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests covering:

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering and interaction
- Form validation and submission
- Theme switching functionality
- Toast notification system

### Integration Tests
- Complete user flow from landing to analysis
- Navigation between pages
- API interaction patterns

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test --coverage
```

## Sample Data
